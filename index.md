## Windspeed and Direction Visualization
Using data from the WW Airport weather station, we will create a radial bar graph of wind speed and direction.

### Steps in Creating the Visualization
1. Scrape weather data from the [Walla Walla Airport NWS page](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/timeseries?site=KALW).
1. Import into [Colab worksheet](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11yl4TzDl3MN-dlVS09SljJnpflDeRrhQ).
1. Build visualization.
